                <h1>The harmony of JavaScript and windows.</h1>
                <h2>The popular desktop operating system paradigm, now in the browser!</h2>
                <p>
                    The web is the new emerging platform for developers worldwide, and
                    it is starting to catch up to the ease-of-use and the styling capabilities
                    of modern desktop operating systems.
                </p><p>
                    And as with most modern desktop operating systems, a popular desktop paradigm
                    has been the window. Versatile, fast and easy to manage, the window is perhaps
                    one of the most important GUI innovations. And now it's coming to the browser.

                <h1>What is JSwm?</h1>
                <h2>JSwm is a window manager for the browser.</h2>
                <p>
                    The JavaScript Window Manager, or JSwm for short, provides a way for web developers
                    to utilise common windowing paradigms without having to go through the tedious
                    process of creating it yourself. It can also double as a fancy, and very easily
                    customisable, browsing experience.
                </p>
                <h3>What can you do with it?</h3>
                <p>
                    JSwm has a variety of frameworks built from the ground up to be as user-friendly and
                    as dependable as possible. You can get all the features that you get from a regular
                    desktop window manager, such as:
                </p>

                    <li><a href="#" data-feature="desktop">A desktop, complete with program icons and shortcuts</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#" data-feature="windows">Windows, manipulated with the mouse and keyboard</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#" data-feature="menubar">Menu bar, with all open windows, and minimised ones too</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#" data-feature="control">Ability to maximise, minimise and close your windows</a></li>
